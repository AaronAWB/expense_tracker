## Summary

This Expense Tracker app was built in JavaScript using the React library and relies primarily on Bootstrap 5 for styling.

The user can enter a new expense entry in the form fields, which will be displayed in the expense list below after clicking the "Add Expense" button. After that, the user can delete indvidual expense entries by clicking the "Delete" button in that row. All expense entries will be saved on closing or refreshing the browser.

This was the first app I built using React. It was a greate exercise in understanding JSX, using components, passing data through components using props and hooks, and using state to dynamically add or delete expense entries. This was also my first time implementing local storage using React's useEffect hook.
